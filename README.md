# kilo editor

A small console based text editor written in `C`. Inspired by the original `kilo` editor by _antirez_.

## Background

The `kilo editor` was first written as a _just for fun_ project by '[antirez](http://antirez.com/news/108)'. The 
goal of the project was to write a console text editor in 1000k lines of code. _antirez's_ posting of the original 
`kilo` editor has prompted many people to attempt to replicate the challenge in their language of choice.

This editor, _my kilo editor_, uses multiple examples online as learning examples. The following were the 
implementations I have studied in writing my own version of the editor:

- _antirez's_ original: http://antirez.com/news/108
- _viewsourcecode.org's_ tutorial: https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html
- Versions written in rust: https://github.com/ilai-deutel/kibi, https://github.com/rhysd/kiro-editor
- Versions written in GO: https://github.com/srinathh/gokilo, https://github.com/hibiken/mini

> One important note: _antirez's_ original editor had a goal of being functional **AND** under 1k lines. That's not 
> my goal. For me this is a learning opportunity. Not only to learn more about low-level console handling but also 
> to learn how the same objectives are accomplished in multiple languages.
